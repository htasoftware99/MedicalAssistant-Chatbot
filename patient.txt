Hi, I have gone through your query. You can also consult a psychiatrist online for further information and to discuss with him or her about schizophrenia in detail as you may be having difficulty managing the symptoms of this disorder by using an anti-seminal medication like PBS (PhD).

Is it harmful for the baby? If not, then spray pesticide is a good choice. For more information consult an infant caretaker online

Hello doctor,My son is four and a half years old, and he is suffering from reactive airway disease (enclosing the reports and prescription).
Kindly suggest based on the above medication that till how long we can safely go ahead with Montair LC Kid. Is there any upper limit of giving this.
I am very skeptical about continuing it in the long run. He is completely fine with this medicine, but if I skip a single dose, he starts coughing just anyways and ends up vomiting everything he had. So I keep on giving him a daily dose of MLC kid. Also, he is a bit aggressive and impatient.
I do not know whether these are the emotional changes associated with this medicine. Please tell me that is he losing his natural immunity due to this.
